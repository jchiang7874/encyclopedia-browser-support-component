# The `window.print()` Method

This `print` method of the `window` object opens up the `Print` dialog in your browser so that you can print the current page's contents using an actual printer.

This is very useful in instances where you need a button that allows the user to print your webpage. It can be called directly from the HTML  through the `onClick` attribute as well, making it very suitable for use with forms.

###Example

	<form>
		<input type="button" onClick="window.print()">
	</form>
