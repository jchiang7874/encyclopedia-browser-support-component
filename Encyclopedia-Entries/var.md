# The HTML `<var>` Tag

The `<var>` element is used to indicate that its contents are a variable in an expression. It is usually shown in the context of an example. It is important to note that it does not represent a usable variable as its function is purely semantic in nature.

The effect of using the var tag is that it italicizes the content by applying the following default CSS rule.

	var {
	  font-style: italic; 
	}

### Example

`<p>Addition of two integers: <var>a</var> + <var>b</var> = <var>c</var>`

Result:

Addition of two integers: *a* + *b* = *c*
